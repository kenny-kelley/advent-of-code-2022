# Advent of Code 2022
This is actually my first Advent of Code. Very exciting.

I have chosen to do it in Ruby. Because I don't have much experience in Ruby. And I hate myself.

So it's probably gonna be sorta ugly, and I'm sure going to violate the spirit of Ruby from time to time. My apologies to you Ruby fans out there.

Maybe at some point I'll go do the Ruby Koans and *g a i n&ensp;e n l i g h t e n m e n t*.

## Development environment
I'm guessing these scripts will work on most Ruby interpreters. Although the file paths might break for Windows. Not sure yet.
